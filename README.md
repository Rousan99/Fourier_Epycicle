You will need matplotlib, svglib, reportlab, numpy, scipy,pylab, PIL.
Steps:
    First Install all these.
    Then download this Repositiry.
    Save all of them (The Fourier_calculation file along with your working file, in my case fou.py file) in same file.
    Now Install ffmpeg. For Linux user like myself, you can just use sudo apt install ffmpeg
    But for windows user follow this method:https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows

After this , all is done.
Now just download a image(It would be helpful if the image is a single body one and it's background is white).
Save it in the same file as Fourier_Calculation.py file, along with your working file.
Now just compile the code.(For command-prompt and Terminal user , It is very easy).
